# Introduction

**clive** is a combination of the cli and hive words. It's an interactive command line application for interacting with
the [Hive](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive) blockchain. Inspired by midnight commander, written in Python.

# Requirements

- python3.10
- poetry (for development)

# Installation in development mode

Since clive is still in development, it's not available on PyPI. To install it in development mode, it's recommended
to install it via poetry as it includes dependencies used during development.

1. [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
2. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/clive.git
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (you can do it your way, using poetry, pyenv, virtualenv, pipx, etc.)

    ```bash
    cd clive/                # Go to repository root directory
    python3.10 -m venv venv/  # Create virtual environment in the venv/ directory
    . venv/bin/activate      # Activate the virtual environment
    ```

4. Install CLIVE

    ```bash
    poetry install  # Install CLIVE and its dev-dependencies in the virtual environment
    ```

# Running

You can simply invoke the TUI application by running the `clive` command.
If you want to use the CLI mode, pass any argument to the `clive` command.

 ```bash
 clive         # Run the TUI application
 clive --help  # Run the CLI application
 ```

# Running via Docker

In order to run clive via Docker, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can find the installation
instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You can then run a docker container with your desired version of Clive.
Specify the first 8 characters of the commit you want to use, or use the "latest" postfix.
The launch command (depending on the branch and chain version you want to use, e.g. TUI latest develop on testnet) will look
like:

 ```bash
docker pull registry.gitlab.syncad.com/hive/clive/testnet-instance-develop:testnet-instance-latest && docker run -ti --registry.gitlab.syncad.com/hive/clive/testnet-instance-develop:testnet-instance-latest
 ```

If you want to run clive in the interactive CLI mode, you should include the `--cli` flag in the command:

 ```bash
docker run -ti registry.gitlab.syncad.com/hive/clive/testnet-instance-develop:testnet-instance-latest --cli
 ```
