Accumulated knowledge from past Clive project reviews. Add new lessons as simple bullets.

> **Note:** This is a staging area for insights discovered during reviews. Items here are concrete examples that complement abstract principles from **review-principles.md** and coding conventions from **CLAUDE.md**. Periodically review this list - recurring patterns may warrant promotion to CLAUDE.md as permanent conventions.
