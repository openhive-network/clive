Run all linting and formatting checks on the codebase.

Execute this command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Report the results:

-   If all checks pass, confirm success
-   If checks fail, summarize which hooks failed and the key issues found
-   For auto-fixable issues (like formatting), mention if files were modified
