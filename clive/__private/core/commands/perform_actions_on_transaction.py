    Performs commands on a transaction object.

    Attributes:
        content: The content to be converted to a transaction.
            (This can be a transaction object, a list of operations, or a single operation.)
        app_state: The app state.
        node: The node used for transaction broadcasting.
        unlocked_wallet: Required if the transaction needs to be signed.
        sign_key: The private key to sign the transaction with. If not provided, the transaction will not be signed.
        autosign: Whether to automatically sign the transaction.
        already_signed_mode: How to handle already signed transactions.
        force_unsign: Whether to remove the signature from the transaction. Even when sign_key is provided.
        chain_id: The chain ID to use when signing the transaction. If not provided, the one from the profile and
            then from the node get_config api will be used as fallback.
        save_file_path: The path to save the transaction to. If not provided, the transaction will not be saved.
            Format is determined by file extension. (e.g. `.json` for JSON, `.bin` for binary, if none of these - JSON)
        force_save_format: The format to force when saving. Matters only when save_file_path is specified.
        broadcast: Whether to broadcast the transaction.

    The transaction object.
